        <p>Software engineering is the job that I feel is the most fitting job out of the above.
            To get it as a job, I would most likely need to take digital technologies in college, and computer science in university.
            However, you might not require an employer, because you can be self employed fairly flexibly in software development, you could be primarily self taught.
            By software engineer I mean more specifically: a normal software engineer that might work for a company in front-end development or back-end development, game developer, most likely indie, or being self-employed and programming for clients.
            In essentiality, I would like to do software development, but also with a creative aspect to it. This could also tie in the animator/artist suggestion or the creative writer suggestion from career quest.
