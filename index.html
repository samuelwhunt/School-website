        <div id="Family-and-me" class="Formatting">
        <h2 id="Family">My Family</h2>
        <p>My mother's name is Emily, and my father's name is Leigh. 
            I have 3 siblings; Ben, my younger brother, Ethan, my older brother, and Lilith, my sister. <br>They are 11, 15, and 17 respectively. 
            My mother was born in Guernsey, and my father was born in . My older brother and my sister, but me and my younger brother were both born in new zealand.</p>
        <h2 id="About-me">About me</h2>
        <!-- I swear to god, even though this looks like it was made by Chat-GPT or something, I swear it isn't. I'm just really bad at making things sound good. -->
        <p>My name is Sam Hunt, full name Samuel William Hunt, I'm 14, I like gaming, watching TV shows, and programming. Some weird things that kind of affect me, kind of don't are as following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am partically colorblind. not tritanope, which would be sort of black and white, but mildly deuteranrope, which is red-green colorblindness. I can still see color though, just makes it difficult to differentiate between colors sometimes.</li>
            <li>I technically skipped a year of primary. My birthday was right at the cutoff point of year one and year zero, and I went into year zero. But, I was learning fast enough for me to be put into year two, skipping a year. Funny thing is, they considered putting my older brother up a year as well, but decided against it so tha the would have more leadership opportunities.</li>
            <li>I think I might have hypermobile fingers. They can bend to be perpendicular to the back of my palm without hurting. I can't do this without using my other hand or a surface to push them back, however.</li>

        <p>I don't travel all that much, so I don't have a favourite place in NZ. I guess that would make it default to just my suburb, Whitby.</p>

        <p>Software engineering is the job that I feel is the most fitting job out of the above.
            To get it as a job, I would most likely need to take digital technologies in college, and computer science in university.
            However, you might not require an employer, because you can be self employed fairly flexibly in software development, you could be primarily self taught.
            By software engineer I mean more specifically: a normal software engineer that might work for a company in front-end development or back-end development, game developer, most likely indie, or being self-employed and programming for clients.
            In essentiality, I would like to do software development, but also with a creative aspect to it. This could also tie in the animator/artist suggestion or the creative writer suggestion from career quest.
